# SlapGameAngular

## Getting Started

I have this project setup to use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) for the package manager. This is just an extension of npm. 

To make sure you can use yarn install it globally with npm
```
npm install -g yarn
```
Now you can use yarn to build and serve the application

## Install Dependencies

In order to build or serve the application, the dependencies need to be downloaded and installed to this project. In order to do this run this command in the terminal
```
yarn
```

## Running the  Development server

The development server will show the application and watch any files in the project. If any of the files change, it will automatically rebuild the project with those changes and refresh the page in the browser.

In order to run the server, run this command in the terminal
```
yarn start
```

Then go to this address in your browser
(http://localhost:4200)
