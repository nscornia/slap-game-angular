# SlapGameAngular

## Getting Started

I have this project setup to use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) for the package manager. This is just an extension of npm. 

To make sure you can use yarn install it globally with npm
```
npm install -g yarn
```
Now you can use yarn to build and serve the application

## Install Dependencies

In order to build or serve the application, the dependencies need to be downloaded and installed to this project. In order to do this run this command in the terminal
```
yarn
```

## Running the  Development server

The development server should launch in a new tab in your broswer. In order to run the server, run this command in the terminal
```
yarn start
```
